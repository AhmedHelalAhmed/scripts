scripts
=======
https://github.com/rsp/scripts

Random shell scripts for different tasks.
Mostly for Linux.

Some of those scripts were written as examples for
[my answers on Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/users/303952/rsp).

Some are just for my own conveniece. Maybe they would be useful to someone else.
